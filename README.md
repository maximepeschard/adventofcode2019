# Advent of Code 2019

My attempt at solving the series of programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019), in Go.

## Running

To build the code for a day :

```sh
# in the directory for the day
go build -o bin/some_binary_name .
```

To obtain the answers for my input, run the produced binary.

## Tests

Some tests are usually provided for the days modules :

```sh
# in the module directory for a day
go test -v
```
